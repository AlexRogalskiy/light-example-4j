Basically, light-java is 44 times faster then sprint-boot with tomcat embedded just
for the raw performance to serve Hello World! 

In order to have a closer comparison, I have created another project spring-boot-undertow with embedded
undertow servlet container (light-java is using undertow core only) and the 
performance is getting a little better. Light-Java is about 33 times faster than spring-boot with undertow embedded.


Upon requests from the community, I have added nodejs and golang examples and here are the testing result.

Node express framework.
To start the server

```
cd node-express
npm install
node server.js

```
The test result.

After I post this online, one of spring developers recommended to test against Spring Boot with Reactor
which is Netty based without servlet container. I am very new to this and might miss something and everyone
is welcomed to submit pull request to enhance this project.

Here is the test result.
